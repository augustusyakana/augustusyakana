- 👋 Hi, I’m Augustus Yuki Yakana, I am making a career switch into technology coming from Occupational Safety & Health in the Construction industry. Born and raised in Pohnpei, in the Federated States of Micronesia, currently living
     in Wahiawa, Hawaii.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development & Software Engineering, whether it be web apps, mobile apps, desktop software, websites, you name it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Fullstack Software Development at BYU Pathway Worldwide. Also supplementing my learning with ZTM's Complete Web Developer Bootcamp.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. I just want to improve my skills and gain more knowledge.
- 📫 You can send me a direct message on github or you can message me on any of my social media pages. Links are on my profile. I reply!
- ⚡ Fun fact: If you get lead poisoning, your body will excrete out some of the lead and about 1/2 of it remains in your body, inside your bones, teeth, etc. SO whenever your body is in distress like when you get injured, or stressed, your body tries to pull calcium from your bones to calm you down but it can't differntiate between the lead and calcium, so it ends up pulling lead back into your system poisoning you all over again. So steer clear of lead. Learned this when I was a Safety Officer.
