- 👋 Hi, I’m Augustus Yuki Yakana. Micronesian father of 4 and husband of more than 10 years, making a career switch into technology coming from Construction Safety. Born and raised in Pohnpei, in the Federated States of Micronesia, currently living
     in Wahiawa, Hawaii. Programming skills (as of Jan. 2024) include frontend web development technologies like HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I have recent experience (academic) using C# in Object Oriented Programming. I have basic use knowledge of Python
     as well. I plan to use Python as my go to language for backend code. I have a database course coming up next month and I cant wait to get started on it.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development & Software Engineering, whether it be web apps, mobile apps, desktop software, websites, you name it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Fullstack Software Development at BYU-Idaho.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. I just want to improve my skills and gain more knowledge so I can use it to help my country.
- 📫 You can send me a direct message on github or you can message me on any of my social media pages. Links are on my profile. I reply!
- ⚡ Fun fact: If you get lead poisoning, your body will excrete out some of the lead and about 1/2 of it remains in your body, inside your bones, teeth, etc. SO whenever your body is in distress like when you get injured, or stressed,
    your body tries to pull calcium from your bones to calm you down but it can't differntiate between the lead and calcium, so it ends up pulling lead back into your system poisoning you all over again. So steer clear of lead.
